Algorithm:

1: Setup data structures
	discovered = Queue for undiscovered DCs
	toProcess = processing queue
	origin
	target
	
	toProcess.add (origin)
	discovered.add (origin)
	
	while toProcess is not empty
	
		checking = toProcess.getNext
		process (checking)
		for all DC from process(checking):
			if the DC is the destination
				stop and do stuff
			else if the DC is not discovered
				toProcess(DC)
				discovered.add(DC)
