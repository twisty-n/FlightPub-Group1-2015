# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Create some basic flight seeds for the API testing stuff
# Replace this later with a flights fixture thang



# To specify our own Fixtures, use a thing similar to below, 
# changing the 'resource.yml' and Rsource.create! as needed

# Load our fixture for Country data
