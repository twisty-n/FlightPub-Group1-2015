Ensure all dependancies are installed

Ruby
Rails
NodeJS
npm
postgre
etc ....

You'll need to set up a working postgre instance to have database access, you are then free to init the
database using the rails/rake console (see documentaion)
Ensure that you have set up a user with access details matching that in the config file
Make sure that you run bundle install to get all of the gems that we will need
